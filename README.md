A command-line implementation of the Phantomscript conversion described [here](https://github.com/jagracey/PhantomScript)

Contributions welcome!

# Installation

    yarn add phantomscript global

or

    npm i phantomscript -g

This will give you access to the `boo` executable, so you can convert to and from phantomscript with ease:

    boo -e "butts" >> secrets.txt

You can see that it worked by using `cat -v`: `cat -v secrets.txt` will print all the unprintables.

Similarly, you can pull in that same data and decode it:

    cat secrets.txt | boo -d

=> "butts"

If you feel like doing work but accomplishing nothing, you can alternate your pipes:

    echo butts | boo -e | boo -d | boo -e | boo -d

=> "butts"

Use `boo --help` for more information.
